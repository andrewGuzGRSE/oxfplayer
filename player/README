This file contains instructions of how to get ONVIF Export Player software built and run


******************************
I. Build external libraries 
******************************

0. Pre-build installations to be done
========================================

In order to go successfully through all the steps of build, following installations are required:
	- MinGW with MSys option.
	  Required to execute prebuild.sh and prerun.sh scripts, which are required to build and run the player itself.
	  Required to build OpenSSL and PortAudio libraries for Qt Creator.
	  Direct link to the latest installer is
	  http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/latest/download?source=files
	  Note! If you have Cygwin with MinGW option configured and installed, it can also be used to perform the actions.
			MSys was chosen only because it's easier to deploy this software package.
	  Note! It is also possible that you will need to add path to MinGW compiler into environment PATH variable to build OpenSSL and PortAudio.
	- Perl.
	  Required to build OpenSSL for Visual Studio.
	  Suggested implementation is ActivePerl, located at
	  http://www.activestate.com/activeperl/downloads
	  Important! Do not use Stawberry Perl, as it was proved to work very unstable with OpenSSL build system.
	- Corresponding version of Visual Studio.
	  Required to build OpenSSL and PortAudio libraries for Visual Studio.
	- 7-zip or any archive tool capable to extract .7z and .tar.gz archives
	  Required to extract Zeranoe FFmpeg build.
	  Required to extract OpenSSL and PortAudio libraries for Visual Studio builds.
	  Note! In order to extract OpenSSL for MinGW build use MSys (or Cygwin) tar, see below for more details.

1. FFMPEG
=======================
Version
--------

Verified versions of FFmpeg are 4.4
Another versions of FFmpeg can also be tried, but it is not guranteed that
it will get linked and executed with ONVIF Player sucessfully

Build instructions
-------------------
	You can go with either of the following options:

	a) Use availible builds recommended by FFmpeg:
	   https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/
 
	   You should download 64-bit SHARED packages. Links to ffmpeg build downloads:
	https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/packages/ffmpeg-4.4-full_build-shared.7z
 	   

	b) Build FFmpeg by yourself following official recommendations:
	   https://ffmpeg.org/trac/ffmpeg/wiki/CrossCompilingForWindows

	c) Use provided script to build lightweight LGPL version of FFmpeg
	   This is an updated script from option b) above. Script name is 
	   cross_compile_ffmpeg.sh and it is located in the same folder with 
	   this README file.
	   
 	   !Note. This script is designed and implemented to run on Linux OS.
	   According to recommendations and experiments, FFmpeg built on 
	   Linux with cross-compiler is much "faster" than the one built 
	   with "native" compilation in windows
	   
	   The following changes have been applied to original script:
	   - all external libraries are switched off;
	   - documentation and programs (ffmpeg.exe, ffplay.exe etc.) generation
	     is disabled;
	   - debug symbols generation is switched off;
	   - target platform is set to 32-bit version;
	   - all DLL and LIB files will be copied to the BUILD folder after
	     the build will be completed


2. OPENSSL
=======================

Version
---------

Verified version(s) of OpenSSL is 1.0.1
Another versions of OpenSSL can also be tried, but it is not guranteed that
it will get linked and executed with ONVIF Player sucessfully. 
Note: security vulnerabilities are of minor importance since the library is solely used for signature verification.

Build instructions
-------------------
	Common build steps:
		- Unpack OpenSSL source code to some path at your PC
		  Important! Create several different source folders, if you 
		  plan to mantain several builds (like VS2010 and VS2012, or
		  MinGW and VS2012)
		  Important! For some reasons MinGW builds need to be extracted 
		  with MSys tar in order the build to finish successfully
		  Execute tar -zxvf /path/to/openssl/archive.tar.gz from MSys 
		  console in order to extract source files
		- Create a folder for build output
		  Important! Create several different output folders,
		  if you plan to mantain several builds (like VS2010 and VS2012, 
		  or MinGW and VS2012)
	MinGW build for Qt Creator with MinGW:
		- Create a folder for build output
		- Run MSys
		- Execute following commands
		  cd /path/to/source/folder
		  ./Configure --prefix=/absolute/path/to/output/folder no-idea no-mdc2 no-rc5 shared mingw
		  make depend
		  make
		  make install
	Visual Studio 2010 and Visual Studio 2012 Build
		- Run corresponding Visual Studio x86 Command Prompt from Start menu
		- Execute following commands
		  cd X:\path\to\source\folder
		  perl Configure VC-WIN32 --prefix=X:\path\to\output\folder
		  ms\do_ms.bat
		  nmake -f ms\ntdll.mak
		  nmake -f ms\ntdll.mak install


3. PORTAUDIO
=======================

Version
-----------
Verified version of PortAudio is 19
Another versions of PortAudio can also be tried, but it is not guranteed
that it will get linked and executed with ONVIF Player sucessfully

	ONVIF Player does not need ASIO support, so follow the steps to build 
	without ASIO support


4. QT
=======================

Downloads page link
--------------------
http://qt-project.org/downloads
http://download.qt-project.org/official_releases/qt/
Please install the followng versions of Qt libraries on your build machine:

	MinGW:
		(>= 5.0.1) for Windows 32-bit
	for Visual Studio 2010:
		(>= 5.0.1) for Windows 32-bit
	for Visual Studio 2012:
		(>= 5.1.0) for Windows 32-bit 



*******************************************
II.  Prepare for ONVIF Export Player build
*******************************************

First of all we need to copy all needed files from external libraries.
This can be done with prebuild.sh script.
The script should be executed from MSys console.
Working directory should be set to the script parent folder.
This script is interactive, so just follow the instruction.

The script needs to know following things:
		- Configuration type
			- MinGW
			- Visual Studio 2010
			- Visual Studio 2012
		- FFmpeg source type
			- binaries from http://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds/
			- built from scratch
		- Path to FFmpeg-1.2-win32-dev folder for Zeranoe FFmpeg build
		or
		- Path to FFmpeg build folder for binaries built from scratch
		- Path to OpenSSL build folder (specified in --prefix)
		- Path to PortAudio build folder (note, that Visual Studio files
		  are searched under path/specified/build/msvc/Win32/Release)

The script does also perform patching of the ffmpeg/include/libavutil/common.h



*******************************
III.  Build ONVIF Export Player  
*******************************
 
2. Visual Studio 
=========================================================

Building using Visual Studio 2019
----------------------------------
- open the solution file /proj/ONVIFPlayer-VS2019/ONVIFPlayer-VS2019.sln.
- ensure, that Qt version is set for a solution:
	Right click the solution file and find a menu item 
	'Change solution's Qt Version'
	Ensure that the right Qt Version is selected
	Click Ok
- select a build configuration and press build.

******************************
IV.  Run ONVIF Export Player  
******************************

As a preparation for execution it is required to ensure that all needed dynamic libraries are in place.
This can be done with prerun.sh script.
The script should be executed from MSys console.
Working directory should be set to the script parent folder.
This script is interactive, so just follow the instruction.

The script needs to know following things
		- Configuration type
			- MinGW
			- Visual Studio 2010
			- Visual Studio 2012
		- FFmpeg source type
			- binaries from http://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds/
			- built from scratch
		- Path to FFmpeg-1.2-win32-shared folder for Zeranoe FFmpeg build
		or
		- Path to FFmpeg build folder for binaries built from scratch
		- Path to OpenSSL build folder (specified in --prefix)
		- Path to PortAudio build folder (note, that Visual Studio files 
		  are searched under path/specified/build/msvc/Win32/Release)

If you run player from your IDE, then you don't need to copy Qt .dll files.
If you run it from any place on the hard disc, then you should copy Qt libraries as well
or make sure path to the QT libraries is in system search path.
